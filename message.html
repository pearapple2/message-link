  <h1>Let's try and see if it works</h1>
  <p>I have to be honest, not being able to text you for days, especially when I have something to tell you/reply to you, sucks terribly, and it really puts me in a terrible state of mind. Again, full disclosure here, I cannot wait for you to come back: this month has been extremely hard for me, and it's not getting better after Korea. I am not sure if I will be able to text you in the 10? 20? 30? minutes window you might finally/graciously have tonight, so here are my replies. 1) I have created this way of communication for emergencies or updates going forward. 
    The link will remain the same, and I will change the message when needed. We only have to come up with an emoticon for whatsapp that means "new message through Github" and we should be good. Hope you can find a safe place to hide the link, but you will see that it redirects you to another page which looks a bit scammy, so there's some extra safety there. 2) As I did for the messaging part, I can do some research for the payment part, even if it would feel a bit too much and I'd rather you do that. It's been 8 months since October and I honestly find it a bit rude 
    that I have to insist on each one contributing evenly to  our expenses. We earn the same money, there are plenty of ways of doing that without getting caught and it's not like you're in a money crunch at the moment. Dinners, travels, houses... I just don't find it fair, I'm sorry, and I expect you to be able to contribute with your half from the next time we see each other. Please let me know if you need any help brainstorming. 3) final part, reply to your 37 messages I received in the half hour window you could text me on Saturday night. Those were particularly shitty, 
    especially because I didn't know you would disappear for the whole weekend (and Monday), leaving me with no opportunity to reply to them at all. I thought we discussed this approach of texting, but evidently I got that wrong. Yes, I had told you on Tuesday that "all good with Friday evening to Sunday evening", and nothing has changed there. She's still going in those days, I'm still staying at home. Of course the problem is with the dog, to the point that this weekend we're supposed to leave the two of us, but we yet don't know if that will be possible or if I'll have to wait
    alone. I am trying, I really am, and it's not a "NO, IMPOSSIBLE" yet. Most of the people I reach out to are (or will be) on holiday because it's August, or have their own pet (and co-living is unfortunately not a thing for mine), or have families visiting, I got all the messages and the reasons for "sorry I can't". This afternoon I'm meeting a couple for this weekend, and I'm monopolizing the conversation (even if I would need her help for some stuff). This way, if I'm the only point of contact they have and if they are willing to repeat the experience, I might be able to use 
    them for the later weekend (I already discussed this with them). Summarizing, I'm doing a lot and I hope you'll trust me on that - but the reason I could not validate immediately the tickets purchase is because I'd like to speak for even 10 minutes about this. And to your message, when you say you're the only one caring about this, let me remind you how much we spoke in the last two/three weeks... or that when you came back from Korea your first question was to have an update about my social life (no worries, no jealousy, you're definetely having many more romantic dinners lately, 
    and duly advertising them all on instagram). The fact is there is no plan B, no Belgium this time, right? So I have to make sure we're both aware of the risks, to be aware of the costs, and also stuff related on your side (how was reaction to concer? What about the new place? What about the girls and Malaga?). Just 10 minutes, not much more, and it's something we can easily do on Thursday (instead of sending me 35+ messages without giving me the opportunity to reply). I will not comment all the messages you sent me, but they kind of hurt ("again, no initiative on your side... I don't get
    it... why don't you want a weekend with me" -> while I reached out to all dogsitters I could find, made plans to hide the current one for next weekend - yet to be confirmed - from her, while I came up with this way of communication (and you seem not to even remember to bring your Dutch phone to be able to see my emails, or to care at all about my finances... am I financially contributing to your relationship with him? Starting to think so...). And no, I had no idea you would not be able to text after Friday, not so little at least. Not to the point you cannot even send me
    a "random kiss", or to show me that you're thinkg about me between family time, his family time, romantic dinner time, "let the whole world of instagram know that I'm having a great time with my husband time"... I know I sound toxic, but this week after Korea -if possible - has been even worse in terms of communication, and I'm hating your time there, and I cannot feel but the least important thing in your life right now, the one you don't even have 30 seconds to talk to or to send a message to. Plus, and I'm still reading/replying to your messages, on Thursday I was still trying
    the unknown dogsitters options, and honestly I also wanted to discuss a little bit about my feelings. You've been extra selfish for the past month, it seems like everything needs to fit into your plans of having it all, russia, korea, romantic dinners, family time, a weekend with me.. it's not so easy, especially when our communication is reduced to a minimum (or does not exist) for weeks. And yet you're once again the rightful one, the only one who cares, the only one who plans, who does stuff... and it's very far from the truth. I also do, but I need to talk to you, and to validate that the
    situations - and its potential downturns - are known to everyone. Take this message: I would be seriously offended... and I mean it... cause you can't do it like that... you just don't plan weekend (what does it mean? I am trying to be available, unfortunately I have a dog, it's not an easy one, I hate myself for this and you have no idea how bad it makes me feel - uh and by the way, all dogsitters I reached out to were magically available in July, when you were in lovely Busan with lovely husband), you don't raise this topic (when?? when?? we barely spoke, and sorry if my feelings
    were something I wanted to address in the only day where we could speak for the past 2-3 weeks) etc"... Is that a fair message? Or can we finally acknolwegde that there are two hurt people here, and maybe they need to talk and align, and not to "assume" and write angry messages (it goes both ways). I also want to talk about the "you don't change your travel of life plans for me but I do it again and again" part when we can finally speak, I don't find it fair at all. Or the "I guess you are not having some nice dinner now and you are not checking the phone" (another lovely message).
    By the way, in the minutes it took me to write this toxic, sad and honestly ugly messages you accessed whatsapp 4-5 times. I'm sorry your relationship with him is now in STASI mode, where you don't even have 20 seconds a day to make me feel a little bit more considered, even during your summer retreat. I hope we'll be able to talk soon, we need that. No names or affectionated parts because it still is a public link</p>
